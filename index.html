    <h1>Love Me</h1>
    <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
    <p>Wait a minute, stop what we're doing
Because I got to tell you now what's on my mind
We've been at this for some time, and I just wanna know
If your heart is feeling just as strong as mine
'Cause even though we got some years in this
It's always brand new to me
See, the <span class="bigger">butterflies</span>, my palms get sweaty
<em class="yuh">My thoughts and my heart stay heavy</em>
You got this kind of affect on me
So maybe we can, we can sit down and just wind down
And speak of all the many reason why we stick around
But really all I want, all I want from you is just to
Love me, love me a little more tonight
Say that your heart belongs to me
'Cause my heart is <span class="highlight">yearning</span> for you
Baby I'm forever loving you
Love me a little more tonight
Say that your <span class="bigger">heart</span> belongs to me
'Cause my heart is yearning for you
Baby, I'm <span class="highlight">forever</span> loving you </p>
<h2>[Pre-Chorus]</h2>
<p>I'ma hold you down tomorrow, more then I held you down today
When I say it's you I mean it, I mean it (he means it)
I'm not gonna slip away, when things get harder
Because the way my heart is <span class="bigger">built</span> for you
This love I've <strong>never</strong> felt, you know I'm planning on forever
It's you, it's me, it's us, you're not alone, no <strong>never</strong>
I could go on and on of what this is and <span class="highlight">promises</span>
Well baby, we got time</p>
<h2>[Pre-Chorus]</h2>
<p>So let's just sit down and just wind down
And speak of all the many reasons why we <span class="bigger">stick</span> around
But really all I want, all I want from you is just to</p>
<h2>[Chorus]</h2>
<p>Love me, love me a little more tonight
Say that your heart belongs to me
'Cause my heart is yearning for you
Baby, I'm <span class="bigger">forever</span> loving you
Love me a little more tonight
Say that your <span class="highlight">heart</span> belongs to me
'Cause my heart is yearning for you
Baby, I'm forever loving</p>
<h2>[Pre-Chorus]</h2>
<p>Let's just sit down, and as we wind down
Let's speak of all the many reason why we stick around
But really all I want, all I <span class="bigger">want</span> from you is just to</p>
<h2>[Chorus]</h2>
Love me, love me a little more tonight (oh, won't you love me, baby)
Say that your heart belongs to me (every little part for me)
'Cause my heart is yearning for you
Baby, I'm forever <span class="highlight">loving</span> you (won't you just be)
Love me a little more tonight (won't you love me, baby)
Say that your heart belongs to me
'Cause my heart is yearning for you
Baby, I'm <span class="bigger">forever</span> loving you
